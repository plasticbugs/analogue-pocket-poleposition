//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Cabinet reverb: a short, dark room around the whole mix. An option, not the
// board.
//
// Punch-Out!!'s po_reverb, unchanged in its sound: three parallel feedback
// comb filters at 29.7, 37.1 and 41.1 ms (mutually prime lengths, so their
// tails do not line up into a ring), each with a one-pole low-pass in its loop
// so the tail darkens as it decays, feedback 5/8 (about 0.4 s to -60 dB, or
// 13/16 and about 1.2 s for Heavy); their sum is added under the dry signal at
// 3/16 (Light, Heavy) or 1/4 (Medium).
//
// Pole Position is stereo where Punch-Out!! is mono, so the combs are fed the
// mid signal, (L + R) / 2, and the one wet tail goes under both channels: the
// dry image is kept, and the room is the same on both sides as a cabinet's is.
//
// One sample per ce (48 kHz); the work is sequential and takes a few dozen
// clocks of the 1024 available. Delay lines in block RAM, 3 x 2048 x 16. All
// arithmetic is shifts and adds; every sum is saturated. Mode 0 passes the
// input through with the same one-sample latency as the other modes.
